<h2 align="center">Animations / Asset Packs</h2>

"We created our own improved Animation / Asset system that lets you create and cycle through your own `Asset Packs` with only a few button presses, allowing you to easily load custom Animations, Icons and Fonts like never before. Think of it as a Theme system that's never been easier."

"You can easily create your own pack, or find some community-made ones on <b><a href="https://momentum-fw.dev/asset-packs">our website</a> or on Discord</b>. Check <a href="https://github.com/Next-Flip/Momentum-Firmware/blob/dev/documentation/file_formats/AssetPacks.md">here</a> for a tutorial on creating your own. Essentially, each <code>Asset Pack</code> can configure its own <code>Anims</code>, <code>Icons</code> & <code>Fonts</code>."

"Once you have some asset packs, upload them to your Flipper in <code>SD/asset_packs</code> (if you did this right you should see <code>SD/asset_packs/PackName/Anims</code> and/or <code>SD/asset_packs/PackName/Icons</code>). Alternatively, install directly using the website."

"After installing the packs to Flipper, hit the <code>Arrow Up</code> button on the main menu and go to <code>Momentum Settings > Interface > Graphics</code>. Here choose which asset pack you want and tweak the other settings how you prefer, then exit the app to reboot and enjoy your fully customized Flipper!"
