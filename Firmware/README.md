## Firmware
The Video Game Module can be used as a standalone device for applications developed for the RP2040 microcontroller, the same as in Raspberry Pi Pico. On this page, you will learn how to install custom firmware on the Video Game Module via Flipper Zero and PC.
## Installing custom firmware via PC
Alternatively, you can install firmware (in the .uf2 format) on the module directly from your computer. For that, you’ll need to connect the module as a USB Mass Storage device 
## Installation
1. Navigate to QFlipper
2. Go to the button labled "firmware"
3. Press "Upload from file"
4. Select the firmware file 
Then you will have more working payloads on your Flipper!
