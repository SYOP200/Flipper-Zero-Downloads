## RFID
Flipper Zero supports low-frequency (LF) radio frequency identification (RFID) technology that is implemented in access control systems, animal chips, and supply chain tracking systems. Unlike NFC cards, LF RFID cards don’t usually provide high levels of security. This technology comes in many form factors, such as plastic cards, key fobs, tags, wristbands, and animal microchips. Flipper Zero has a low-frequency RFID module that can read, save, emulate, and write LF RFID cards.
## RFID menu
You can access the 125 kHz RFID application from the Main Menu. In the application, you can read, save, emulate, write, and generate new LF RFID cards. <br>
- Read: reads and saves LF RFID cards.
- Saved: lists saved cards that can be emulated and written to a rewritable card.
- Add Manually: generates new virtual LF RFID cards by entering the cards’ ID.  
- Extra Actions: allows to read LF RFID cards with a preselected ASK or PSK coding.
## Installation
1. Navigate to QFlipper
2. Go to your SD card
3. Open the `RFID` folder
4. Press "Upload"
Then you will have more working `RFID` tags on your Flipper!
