## FLIPPER ZERO DOWNLOADS
I’ve been working with the Flipper Zero for a while and noticed that useful files, scripts, and plugins are scattered all over the place. So I put together this curated GitHub repo that collects commonly used Flipper Zero assets in one spot.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> I do not own these files. They belong to their respective creators, mostly listed in the credits.

## About
This repository was created so that you dont have to find Flipper Zero files yourself. This repository has all of the resources for you if you are new to Flipper Zero or you just want to get more files. Either way, you are welcome here!
## Installation

### Method 1: Copy Files to SD Card

Directly copying the files to the Flipper's SD card is the fastest and safest method, but you have to [dismount the SD card](https://docs.flipperzero.one/basics/sd-card#g4-removing-the-sd-card) and plug it into the computer directly. <br>

1. Download and extract or [Git-clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) this repo to your computer.
2. Open the downloaded / cloned repository in a File Explorer.
3. [Dismount the SD card](https://docs.flipperzero.one/basics/sd-card#g4-removing-the-sd-card) from the Flipper and mount it to your computer
4. Copy the desired files from the repo to the `(file type)` folder on your SD Card
5. Dismount the SD card from your computer and mount it to your Flipper

### Method 2: Copy Files using [QFlipper](https://flipperzero.one/update)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Because of Flipper limitations, the transfer via QFlipper can take a long time, depending on how many files you want to copy.
> If you only want to copy several files, this will work fine, but if you want to load the entire repo. onto your Flipper, **I strongly recommend copying the files directly onto the SD card**.

1. [Git-clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) or Download and extract this repository to your computer.
2. Connect your Flipper to your PC using a USB-C cable.
3. Open [QFlipper](https://flipperzero.one/update)
4. Verify that your Flipper shows "Connected"
5. Ensure your Flipper is fully up-to-date:
   1. Look for the green "Update" button near the middle-right of the application.
   2. Press "Update" and allow the Flipper to complete the Update process and then reboot before continuing.
6. Open the File Manager by selecting the "File Manager" icon (piece of paper) on the top left of the QFlipper application.
7. Select `SD Card`, then navigate to the `(file type)` folder by double-clicking its icon.
8. Drag the downloaded files you want on your Flipper from the File Explorer into the QFlipper File Manager.

### Method 3: Copy Files using the [Flipper Mobile App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.flipperdevices.app)

1. Download/copy the desired files from the database to your smartphone, e.g. to the Download folder. Be sure the extension is matching the type of file you are downloading.
2. Open the Flipper Mobile App and go to Connected > Options > activate Experimental Options
3. Open the now appearing "File Manager" > ext > (file type) > upload symbol > Choose file from your Download folder
4. The file can be found on your Flipper Zero > (file type) > Saved

>[!IMPORTANT]
>If the file you downloaded did not work, please report it as a bug so we can fix the file or remove it.
